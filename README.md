# Shelfiy — Inventory Management Made Simple
Shelfiy is a modern inventory management app built on the MERN stack, designed to help businesses track products, suppliers, and stock levels with clarity and control. It features:
- Role-based access control: Admins have full CRUD access, while managers can only edit — ensuring secure, permission-aware workflows.
- Global and scoped indexes: Products and suppliers are listed in clean, unified views, with intuitive navigation between index and form pages.
- Robust backend architecture: Express routes are flat and predictable, with centralized error handling and modular controller logic.
- User-friendly frontend: React components are structured for clarity, with scoped feedback, clean exports, and seamless integration with backend services.
- Scalable design: Shelfiy is built for maintainability, with thoughtful separation of concerns and consistent code conventions across the stack.
Whether you're managing a warehouse or a small shop, Shelfiy gives you the tools to stay organized, secure, and efficient.
